AddressBook
===========

This is my playground for an Android AddressBook application

The implemented functionality so far:
- data fetch: statically generated during application start
- translation in english and croatian
- functionality to add contact (no persistent storage)

TODO:
- data fetch: using Google GSON from file
- add profile picture
- context menu delete contact
- add ActionSherlock
- data fetch: cloud storage of data
- data fetch: from contacts on phone (do this in separate branch)
